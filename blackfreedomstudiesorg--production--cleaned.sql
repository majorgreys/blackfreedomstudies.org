Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.</p><p>\r\n	For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West.  This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.</p><p>\r\n	The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights & Black Power movements in several regions and\r\n	<em>numerous</em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined.  For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s.  Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery.  Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;“the promised land that wasn’t” as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.</p><!--pagebreak--><p>\r\n	One longstanding key issue is school segregation.  In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War.  From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence.  Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall’s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls.  In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 \r\n	<em>Plessy</em> v. <em>Ferguson</em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Board</em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.</p><p>\r\n	Similarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West.  Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.</p><p>\r\n	Thus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America.  The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures \r\n	<em>beyond the South</em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.</p><p>\r\n	If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was \r\n	<em>not </em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem?  The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson‘s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White</em> and Mary Poole‘s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,</em> as well as Thomas Sugrue‘s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis</em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty</em>.  The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians.  By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.</p><p>\r\n	Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In \r\n	<em>The Business of Black Power</em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math.  Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore.  In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty</em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women’s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,</em> Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.</p><p>\r\n	The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.</p><p>\r\n	We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.  Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff.  Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg’s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.</p><p>\r\n	The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants.  At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it.  The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.  Our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies.</p><h4>Program of Study</h4><p>\r\n	The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  Many professors use June for their own research and July-August for family vacations&mdash;which is why we want to schedule it in June. Also, the Sarah Lawrence College facilities are available during that period.</p><p>\r\n	The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography and scholarship of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. And, the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, at one level unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.</p><p>\r\n	The seminar will incorporate readings in the field and participant writing workshops, research and informational sessions, as well as discussion of processes from research to publication.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or approach that s/he is working towards that will be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass readings in the field and work-shopping.  We will also interspace workshops on the writing process itself and bring in various guest lecturers.</p><p>\r\n	In turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person’s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development; then they will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-08-25 21:18:08','2014-09-02 03:40:40','67cd0d5a-34a3-461a-ab00-9d52f1b2133f'),(108,108,'en_us','About',NULL,'<p><strong><img src=\"{asset:186:photo}\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"><br></strong></p><p><strong>Conversations in Black Freedom Studies</strong> is a monthly roundtable discussion at the Schomburg Center with authors and experts in Black history.&nbsp;Held on the first Thursday of every month from&nbsp;6-8 pm, these conversations focus on a theme --from the Jim Crow North to the Black Panther Party, from educational inequality to the Black Arts Movement.   They are geared for New York City teachers, parents, students, scholars, activists, and policy-makers. Black Freedom Studies has introduced a new paradigm for research and scholarship on the long Black revolt, challenging older conceptions of geography, leadership, ideology, culture and chronology to deepen popular understandings of the scope of the Black freedom struggle. With the closing of a number of black bookstores, there are fewer spaces where a diversity of people can gather to hear and discuss new scholarship in African American history.&nbsp;CBFS aims to begin to fill that need.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"{asset:175:photo}\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"></p><p>One dimension of the series is the significance of the <strong>intergenerational findings</strong> that have emerged in the research. In other words, the new paradigm suggests a dramatically different chronology in Black Freedom Studies, including at least two generations. For instance, Amiri Baraka’s mentors included not only Sterling Brown and Margaret Walker from the Popular Front generation but also Langston Hughes from the Harlem Renaissance.</p><p>Second, another aspect of Black Freedom Studies is the <strong>importance of the Harlem Grassroots Intellectual Tradition</strong>. In other words, for far too long we have neglected Malcolm X as a working-class intellectual alongside the fact that Malcolm X was representative of a grassroots intellectual tradition that predated Antonio Gramsci. The work on Hubert Harrison, the Socrates of the Harlem Renaissance, and the use of the Negro World as a vehicle for a mass self-education movement provides another important window into that grand Harlem tradition. That tradition of mass self-education was the groundwork for the “<em>Each One Teach One</em>” practices in the Black Arts Renaissance and the Black Power Movement with its countless liberation schools, student study circles, museum, libraries and salons. These discussions may be helpful to teachers, parents and students facing the challenges of austerity policies.</p><p><img src=\"{asset:176:photo}\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"></p><p>A third dimension of Black Freedom Studies is the <strong>promising emphasis on culture</strong>, centering on the Black Arts Renaissance. <em>Ironically, Harlem has been grossly neglected in the new Black Arts Movement scholarship.</em> And that neglect is distorting the contours of that research. We should take advantage of the pioneers and veterans of the Black Arts Renaissance in Harlem that remain available for roundtable discussions. If those conversations are recorded they might serve as primary sources for the scholarship to come. Sam Anderson, Jitu Weusi, Ted Wilson, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez are close at hand. And we should take the opportunity to consider the Nuyorican Arts Renaissance that flowered at times alongside and at times within the bosom of the Black Arts Movement. Felipe Luciano can shed light on the working of the Last Poets from that vantage point; and of course, the rest of the remaining Last Poets should be at the center of such a roundtable. Furthermore, Askia Toure is not far away and he was also a pioneer in the Black Arts Movement alongside Lou Gossett and so forth. Harlem was the home of Langston Hughes who seems to have cultivated the groundwork for many features of the Black Arts Renaissance, including its international character. And thus far we have neglected important figures like Elombe Brath who political and cultural work in black culture and consciousness began to flower in the 1950s, attracting many African liberation leaders to the bosom of Harlem. In fact, next year will mark the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of <em>Blues People</em>; and when I organized the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary symposium at Sarah Lawrence College the response was overwhelming.</p><p>A fourth aspect of Black Freedom Studies in the <strong>importance of political activism and public policy alternatives</strong> in the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North. Johanna Fernandez has highlighted the way that the Young Lords used mass media to dramatize long dormant public policy problems like lead paint to make crucial changes. Of course, the Young Lords were “in the tradition” of SNCC and the Civil Rights Revolution. And we could not miss an opportunity to talk about Brooklyn and the Bronx CORE and so forth. From the citizenship schools to the liberation schools, Black Power aimed to train generations in not only self-worth but also self-governance.</p><p>A fifth characteristic of Black Freedom Studies its <strong>attention to economic struggles</strong>, captured in several anthologies such as <em>The Business of Black Power</em> and <em>Black Power at Work</em>. In many ways, this is the case of the genius of Black Labor that remains untold. Furthermore, we might also consider the rekindled debates about the nature of internal colonialism in that venue.</p><p><img src=\"{asset:178:photo}\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"></p><p>A sixth feature of Black Freedom Studies is <strong>strategic importance of women’s leadership and the organizing tradition</strong>. And there is some phenomenal new work on that subject, including not only <em>Sisters in the Struggle</em> but also <em>Want to Start A Revolution: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle?</em></p><p>A seventh aspect of Black Freedom Studies is <strong>rethinking Malcolm X</strong>. Given the controversy and Pulitzer Prize for Manning Marable’s recent biography, there is no shortage of important discussion on this subject. Of course, Malcolm X is at the center of rethinking Black Power; so the conversations that fashion some basic intellectual consensus on that research agenda is essential. With the Malcolm X papers at hand, there is no place better suited for such conversations than the Schomburg.</p><p>An eighth dimension is that of <strong>Black Internationalism</strong> and no community is better positioned than Harlem to appreciate the fact that the local is also simultaneously international. Michael West edited <em>From Toussaint to Tupac: The Black International Since the Age of Revolution</em>. Brent Hayes Edwards has made a major contribution in <em>The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism</em>. And Tyler Stovall complements that conversation with <em>Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light</em>.</p><p>Finally, since this is the fortieth anniversary of the 1972 Gary Agenda, we might consider some public policy and self-governance conversations about <strong>the contours of the National Black Agenda</strong> then and now, including the Harlem Agenda for 2012 and the future.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-08-25 21:22:19','2014-09-04 18:53:19','6171ac9c-3d10-4064-b6aa-1a6abc13e2d2'),(111,109,'en_us','Schomburg-Logo',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-08-26 01:53:36','2014-09-02 02:43:23','74224611-d849-4dec-9a5e-42324725d75d'),(112,110,'en_us','cwilder',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-08-28 01:44:09','2014-08-28 01:44:09','1a02798f-1915-4c10-b0cd-7e04790450c1'),(113,111,'en_us','Craig Steven Wilder',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Massachusetts Institute of Technology','craigswilder','cwilder@mit.edu','<p>Craig Steven Wilder studies American urban, intellectual, and cultural history.

However, in those fifty years, scholars have habitually neglected the role that such women played in drafting blueprints for the Black Power Generation.</p><p>Please join Gloria Richardson, Rosemary Mealy and Komozi Woodard in an important discussion of that central yet neglected dimension that women played in the radicalization of Malcolm X. At the helm of the Cambridge Movement, Gloria Richardson was the model for Grassroots leadership that Malcolm X outlined in <em>Message to the Grassroots</em>.

While that&nbsp;war was under-resourced and dwarfed by the War in Vietnam,&nbsp;people across the country fought to make programs responsive to&nbsp;the needs and perspectives of the poor as well as the privileged.&nbsp;Join us for a timely discussion as four scholars discuss how&nbsp;grassroots campaigns for welfare rights and economic justice,&nbsp;sought to make the federal government accountable to poor&nbsp;people and the successes and limitations of the War on Poverty&nbsp;programs that were created.\\\" -- Jeanne Theoharis<\\/p>\",\"13\":[\"95\",\"96\",\"97\"],\"5\":{\"date\":\"11\\/7\\/2013\"},\"14\":[\"90\",\"94\",\"92\"],\"17\":\"\"}}','2014-08-25 20:39:32','2014-08-25 20:39:32','1f4e1ae4-2372-49f3-838a-09d6e92a6e5b'),(64,100,4,1,'en_us',1,'','{\"typeId\":null,\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Devorah Heitner\",\"slug\":\"devorah-heitner\",\"postDate\":1409000713,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"7\":\"\",\"10\":\"\",\"9\":\"\",\"11\":\"http:\\/\\/blackpowertv.com\\/\",\"12\":[\"99\"],\"8\":\"DevorahHeitner\"}}','2014-08-25 21:05:13','2014-08-25 21:05:13','433a7ec5-f245-4f1d-9295-c68dd5f72055'),(65,102,4,1,'en_us',1,'','{\"typeId\":null,\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Madeline Anderson\",\"slug\":\"madeline-anderson\",\"postDate\":1409000826,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"7\":\"\",\"10\":\"\",\"9\":\"\",\"11\":\"\",\"12\":[\"101\"],\"8\":\"\"}}','2014-08-25 21:07:06','2014-08-25 21:07:06','395f01c7-822d-4229-ae90-f095adc8ac35'),(66,104,3,1,'en_us',1,'','{\"typeId\":\"3\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Black Power TV\",\"slug\":\"black-power-tv\",\"postDate\":1409000908,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"2\":\"<p>\\u201cOn December 5, Conversations in Black Freedom Studies will present <em style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\\\">Black Power TV<\\/em> author Devorah Heitner in a discussion on the rise of African-American public television: New York\\u2019s <em style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\\\">Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant<\\/em> and Boston\\u2019s <em style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\\\">Say Brother<\\/em>, as well as Black America\\u2019s <em>So<\\/em><em>ul<\\/em><em>! <\\/em>& <em style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: initial;\\\">Black Journal<\\/em>.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West.  This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights & Black Power movements in several regions and<em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined.  For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s.  Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery.  Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>One longstanding key issue is school segregation.  In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War.  From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence.  Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls.  In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>Similarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West.  Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>Thus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America.  The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem?  The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>.  The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians.  By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math.  Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore.  In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em> Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.  Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff.  Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.<\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants.  At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it.  The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.  Our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies.<\\/p><h2>Program of Study<\\/h2><p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  Many professors use June for their own research and July-August for family vacations&mdash;which is why we want to schedule it in June. Also, the Sarah Lawrence College facilities are available during that period.<\\/p><p>The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography and scholarship of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. And, the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, at one level unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.<\\/p><p>The seminar will incorporate readings in the field and participant writing workshops, research and informational sessions, as well as discussion of processes from research to publication.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or approach that s\\/he is working towards that will be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass readings in the field and work-shopping.  We will also interspace workshops on the writing process itself and bring in various guest lecturers.<\\/p><p>In turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\\u2019s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development; then they will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"\"}}','2014-08-25 21:18:08','2014-08-25 21:18:08','8aed825f-2315-461e-8f00-db222096e379'),(69,108,7,1,'en_us',1,'','{\"typeId\":\"10\",\"authorId\":null,\"title\":\"About\",\"slug\":\"about\",\"postDate\":1409001739,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"2\":\"<p>Conversations in Black Freedom Studies is a monthly roundtable discussion at the Schomburg Center with authors and experts in Black history.&nbsp;Held on the first Thursday of every month from&nbsp;6-8 pm, these conversations focus on a theme --from the Jim Crow North to the Black Panther Party, from educational inequality to the Black Arts Movement.   They are geared for New York City teachers, parents, students, scholars, activists, and policy-makers. Black Freedom Studies has introduced a new paradigm for research and scholarship on the long Black revolt, challenging older conceptions of geography, leadership, ideology, culture and chronology to deepen popular understandings of the scope of the Black freedom struggle. With the closing of a number of black bookstores, there are fewer spaces where a diversity of people can gather to hear and discuss new scholarship in African American history.&nbsp;CBFS aims to begin to fill that need.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>The following text is from the original proposal for CBFS.<\\/p><p>This would be a series of roundtable discussions with authors and experts in Black Freedom Studies that might culminate in a Black Power Studies Symposium aimed at New York City teachers, parents and students alongside scholars, educators and policy-makers. Black Freedom Studies has introduced a new paradigm for research and scholarship on the Long Black Revolt, challenging the older geography, leadership, ideology, culture and chronology of Civil Rights historiography. If we record and videotape these conversations, then several publications and references might be produced to support teachers, parents and students a mass education and self-education initiative. And the aim is the help our communities identify, explore, appreciate, develop, and master their own phenomenal human resources, including their wealth in the kind of imaginative power that makes history.<\\/p><p>These conversations might capture several dimensions of the new scholarship, including these: 1) an intergenerational time frame; 2) grassroots intellectual tradition; 3) Black Arts Renaissance and Jazz Revolution; 4) self-governance and public policy; 5) Black Power at Work and the Business of Black Power; 6) the genius of Women\\u2019s Leadership and the Stamina of the Organizing Tradition; 7) Rethinking Malcolm X historiography and legacy; and 8) Harlem politics at the center of Black Internationalism.<\\/p><p>One dimension is the significance of the intergenerational findings that have emerged in the research. In other words, the new paradigm suggests a dramatically different chronology in Black Freedom Studies, including at least two generations. For instance, Amiri Baraka\\u2019s mentors included not only Sterling Brown and Margaret Walker from the Popular Front generation but also Langston Hughes from the Harlem Renaissance.<\\/p><p>Second, another aspect of Black Freedom Studies is the importance of the Harlem Grassroots Intellectual Tradition. In other words, for far too long we have neglected Malcolm X as a working-class intellectual alongside the fact that Malcolm X was representative of a grassroots intellectual tradition that predated Antonio Gramsci. The work on Hubert Harrison, the Socrates of the Harlem Renaissance, and the use of the Negro World as a vehicle for a mass self-education movement provides another important window into that grand Harlem tradition. That tradition of mass self-education was the groundwork for the \\u201c<em>Each One Teach One<\\/em>\\u201d practices in the Black Arts Renaissance and the Black Power Movement with its countless liberation schools, student study circles, museum, libraries and salons. These discussions may be helpful to teachers, parents and students facing the challenges of austerity policies.<\\/p><p>A third dimension of Black Freedom Studies is the promising emphasis on culture, centering on the Black Arts Renaissance. <em>Ironically, Harlem has been grossly neglected in the new Black Arts Movement scholarship.<\\/em> And that neglect is distorting the contours of that research. We should take advantage of the pioneers and veterans of the Black Arts Renaissance in Harlem that remain available for roundtable discussions. If those conversations are recorded they might serve as primary sources for the scholarship to come. Sam Anderson, Jitu Weusi, Ted Wilson, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez are close at hand. And we should take the opportunity to consider the Nuyorican Arts Renaissance that flowered at times alongside and at times within the bosom of the Black Arts Movement. Felipe Luciano can shed light on the working of the Last Poets from that vantage point; and of course, the rest of the remaining Last Poets should be at the center of such a roundtable. Furthermore, Askia Toure is not far away and he was also a pioneer in the Black Arts Movement alongside Lou Gossett and so forth. Harlem was the home of Langston Hughes who seems to have cultivated the groundwork for many features of the Black Arts Renaissance, including its international character. And thus far we have neglected important figures like Elombe Brath who political and cultural work in black culture and consciousness began to flower in the 1950s, attracting many African liberation leaders to the bosom of Harlem. In fact, next year will mark the 50<sup>th<\\/sup> anniversary of the publication of <em>Blues People<\\/em>; and when I organized the 40<sup>th<\\/sup> anniversary symposium at Sarah Lawrence College the response was overwhelming.<\\/p><p>A fourth aspect of Black Freedom Studies in the importance of political activism and public policy alternatives in the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North. Johanna Fernandez has highlighted the way that the Young Lords used mass media to dramatize long dormant public policy problems like lead paint to make crucial changes. Of course, the Young Lords were \\u201cin the tradition\\u201d of SNCC and the Civil Rights Revolution. And we could not miss an opportunity to talk about Brooklyn and the Bronx CORE and so forth. From the citizenship schools to the liberation schools, Black Power aimed to train generations in not only self-worth but also self-governance.<\\/p><p>A fifth characteristic of Black Freedom Studies its attention to economic struggles, captured in several anthologies such as <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em> and <em>Black Power at Work<\\/em>. In many ways, this is the case of the genius of Black Labor that remains untold. Furthermore, we might also consider the rekindled debates about the nature of internal colonialism in that venue.<\\/p><p>A sixth feature of Black Freedom Studies is strategic importance of women\\u2019s leadership and the organizing tradition. And there is some phenomenal new work on that subject, including not only <em>Sisters in the Struggle<\\/em> but also <em>Want to Start A Revolution: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle?<\\/em><\\/p><p>A seventh aspect of Black Freedom Studies is rethinking Malcolm X. Given the controversy and Pulitzer Prize for Manning Marable\\u2019s recent biography, there is no shortage of important discussion on this subject. Of course, Malcolm X is at the center of rethinking Black Power; so the conversations that fashion some basic intellectual consensus on that research agenda is essential. With the Malcolm X papers at hand, there is no place better suited for such conversations than the Schomburg.<\\/p><p>An eighth dimension is that of Black Internationalism and no community is better positioned than Harlem to appreciate the fact that the local is also simultaneously international. Michael West edited <em>From Toussaint to Tupac: The Black International Since the Age of Revolution<\\/em>. Brent Hayes Edwards has made a major contribution in <em>The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism<\\/em>. And Tyler Stovall complements that conversation with <em>Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light<\\/em>.<\\/p><p>Finally, since this is the fortieth anniversary of the 1972 Gary Agenda, we might consider some public policy and self-governance conversations about the contours of the National Black Agenda then and now, including the Harlem Agenda for 2012 and the future.<\\/p>\"}}','2014-08-25 21:27:23','2014-08-25 21:27:23','de9ddfdf-7502-497e-8440-c6dbe8a442bf'),(70,2,1,1,'en_us',3,'','{\"typeId\":\"1\",\"authorId\":null,\"title\":\"Homepage\",\"slug\":\"homepage\",\"postDate\":1408482960,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"2\":\"<p>The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture brings the campus to the community for a series of roundtable conversations on the first Thursday of each month.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West.  This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights & Black Power movements in several regions and<em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined.  For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s.  Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery.  Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>One longstanding key issue is school segregation.  In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War.  From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence.  Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls.  In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>Similarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West.  Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>Thus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America.  The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem?  The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>.  The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians.  By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math.  Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore.  In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em> Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.  Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff.  Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.<\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants.  At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it.  The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.  Our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies.<\\/p><h2>Program of Study<\\/h2><p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  Many professors use June for their own research and July-August for family vacations&mdash;which is why we want to schedule it in June. Also, the Sarah Lawrence College facilities are available during that period.<\\/p><p>The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography and scholarship of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. And, the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, at one level unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.<\\/p><p>The seminar will incorporate readings in the field and participant writing workshops, research and informational sessions, as well as discussion of processes from research to publication.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or approach that s\\/he is working towards that will be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass readings in the field and work-shopping.  We will also interspace workshops on the writing process itself and bring in various guest lecturers.<\\/p><p>In turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\\u2019s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development; then they will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"\"}}','2014-08-28 15:10:50','2014-08-28 15:10:50','221820d0-c96c-45c6-abfd-e734b223877f'),(114,107,2,1,'en_us',3,'','{\"typeId\":\"2\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Summer 2015 Seminar\",\"slug\":\"summer-2015\",\"postDate\":1409001480,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"2\":\"<h1>Rethinking Black Freedom Studies in the Jim Crow North<\\/h1><p>Deadline: March 2, 2015<br>\\r\\nDates: June 15-June 26 (2 weeks)<br>\\r\\nProject Director(s): Komozi Woodard, Sarah Lawrence College, and Jeanne Theoharis, Brooklyn College, CUNY<br>\\r\\nLocation: Bronxville, NY<br>\\r\\nFor more information: kwoodard@sarahlawrence.edu (914) 395-2427<\\/p><p>Supported by a grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities<\\/p><p>Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West.  This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights & Black Power movements in several regions and\\r\\n\\t<em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined.  For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s.  Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery.  Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation.  In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War.  From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence.  Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls.  In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 \\r\\n\\t<em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West.  Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America.  The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures \\r\\n\\t<em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was \\r\\n\\t<em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem?  The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>.  The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians.  By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In \\r\\n\\t<em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math.  Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore.  In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em> Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.  Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff.  Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants.  At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it.  The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.  Our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies.<\\/p><h4>Program of Study<\\/h4><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  Many professors use June for their own research and July-August for family vacations&mdash;which is why we want to schedule it in June. Also, the Sarah Lawrence College facilities are available during that period.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography and scholarship of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. And, the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, at one level unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will incorporate readings in the field and participant writing workshops, research and informational sessions, as well as discussion of processes from research to publication.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or approach that s\\/he is working towards that will be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass readings in the field and work-shopping.

Yet, until recently, these campaigns have not received the historical attention they have deserved. Poor people&mdash;and poor Black mothers in particular&mdash;reshaped notions of rights, dignity, and citizenship in struggles across the country. They redefined militancy and self-determination, insisting that public assistance and economic access were a key to a free Black people. These grassroots struggles led President Lyndon Johnson\'s to declare a federal commitment to a War on Poverty. While that war was under-resourced and dwarfed by the War in Vietnam, people across the country fought to make programs responsive to the needs and perspectives of the poor as well as the privileged. Join us for a timely discussion as four scholars discuss how grassroots campaigns for welfare rights and economic justice, sought to make the federal government accountable to poor people and the successes and limitations of the War on Poverty programs that were created.\\\"&nbsp;<\\/p><p>-- Jeanne Theoharis<\\/p>\",\"19\":\"\",\"14\":[\"90\",\"94\",\"92\"],\"17\":\"\"}}','2014-09-04 16:44:44','2014-09-04 16:44:44','96ab6846-359f-42ac-bc8b-7cedc4743e64'),(173,104,3,1,'en_us',4,'','{\"typeId\":\"3\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Black Power TV\",\"slug\":\"black-power-tv\",\"postDate\":1409000880,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"13\":[\"105\"],\"5\":{\"date\":\"12\\/5\\/2013\"},\"18\":\"<p>\\u201cOn December 5, Conversations in Black Freedom Studies will present <em>Black Power TV<\\/em> author Devorah Heitner in a discussion on the rise of African-American public television: New York\\u2019s <em>Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant<\\/em> and Boston\\u2019s <em>Say Brother<\\/em>, as well as Black America\\u2019s <em>So<\\/em><em>ul<\\/em><em>! <\\/em>& <em>Black Journal<\\/em>.

in Black Freedom Studies<\\/strong> is a monthly roundtable discussion at the Schomburg Center with authors and experts in Black history.&nbsp;Held on the first Thursday of every month from&nbsp;6-8 pm, these conversations focus on a theme --from the Jim Crow North to the Black Panther Party, from educational inequality to the Black Arts Movement.   They are geared for New York City teachers, parents, students, scholars, activists, and policy-makers. Black Freedom Studies has introduced a new paradigm for research and scholarship on the long Black revolt, challenging older conceptions of geography, leadership, ideology, culture and chronology to deepen popular understandings of the scope of the Black freedom struggle. With the closing of a number of black bookstores, there are fewer spaces where a diversity of people can gather to hear and discuss new scholarship in African American history.&nbsp;CBFS aims to begin to fill that need.&nbsp;<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"\\/assets\\/images\\/events\\/_photo\\/Schomburg_BlackFreedomStudies_selects0002.jpg#asset:175:photo\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\\\"><\\/p><p>One dimension of the series is the significance of the <strong>intergenerational findings<\\/strong> that have emerged in the research. In other words, the new paradigm suggests a dramatically different chronology in Black Freedom Studies, including at least two generations. For instance, Amiri Baraka\\u2019s mentors included not only Sterling Brown and Margaret Walker from the Popular Front generation but also Langston Hughes from the Harlem Renaissance.<\\/p><p>Second, another aspect of Black Freedom Studies is the <strong>importance of the Harlem Grassroots Intellectual Tradition<\\/strong>. In other words, for far too long we have neglected Malcolm X as a working-class intellectual alongside the fact that Malcolm X was representative of a grassroots intellectual tradition that predated Antonio Gramsci. The work on Hubert Harrison, the Socrates of the Harlem Renaissance, and the use of the Negro World as a vehicle for a mass self-education movement provides another important window into that grand Harlem tradition. That tradition of mass self-education was the groundwork for the \\u201c<em>Each One Teach One<\\/em>\\u201d practices in the Black Arts Renaissance and the Black Power Movement with its countless liberation schools, student study circles, museum, libraries and salons. These discussions may be helpful to teachers, parents and students facing the challenges of austerity policies.<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"\\/assets\\/images\\/events\\/_photo\\/IMGL7472.JPG#asset:176:photo\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\\\"><\\/p><p>A third dimension of Black Freedom Studies is the <strong>promising emphasis on culture<\\/strong>, centering on the Black Arts Renaissance. <em>Ironically, Harlem has been grossly neglected in the new Black Arts Movement scholarship.<\\/em> And that neglect is distorting the contours of that research. We should take advantage of the pioneers and veterans of the Black Arts Renaissance in Harlem that remain available for roundtable discussions. If those conversations are recorded they might serve as primary sources for the scholarship to come. Sam Anderson, Jitu Weusi, Ted Wilson, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez are close at hand. And we should take the opportunity to consider the Nuyorican Arts Renaissance that flowered at times alongside and at times within the bosom of the Black Arts Movement. Felipe Luciano can shed light on the working of the Last Poets from that vantage point; and of course, the rest of the remaining Last Poets should be at the center of such a roundtable. Furthermore, Askia Toure is not far away and he was also a pioneer in the Black Arts Movement alongside Lou Gossett and so forth. Harlem was the home of Langston Hughes who seems to have cultivated the groundwork for many features of the Black Arts Renaissance, including its international character. And thus far we have neglected important figures like Elombe Brath who political and cultural work in black culture and consciousness began to flower in the 1950s, attracting many African liberation leaders to the bosom of Harlem. In fact, next year will mark the 50<sup>th<\\/sup> anniversary of the publication of <em>Blues People<\\/em>; and when I organized the 40<sup>th<\\/sup> anniversary symposium at Sarah Lawrence College the response was overwhelming.<\\/p><p>A fourth aspect of Black Freedom Studies in the <strong>importance of political activism and public policy alternatives<\\/strong> in the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North. Johanna Fernandez has highlighted the way that the Young Lords used mass media to dramatize long dormant public policy problems like lead paint to make crucial changes. Of course, the Young Lords were \\u201cin the tradition\\u201d of SNCC and the Civil Rights Revolution. And we could not miss an opportunity to talk about Brooklyn and the Bronx CORE and so forth. From the citizenship schools to the liberation schools, Black Power aimed to train generations in not only self-worth but also self-governance.<\\/p><p>A fifth characteristic of Black Freedom Studies its <strong>attention to economic struggles<\\/strong>, captured in several anthologies such as <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em> and <em>Black Power at Work<\\/em>. In many ways, this is the case of the genius of Black Labor that remains untold. Furthermore, we might also consider the rekindled debates about the nature of internal colonialism in that venue.<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"\\/assets\\/images\\/events\\/_photo\\/JeanneKomozi.jpg#asset:178:photo\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\\\"><\\/p><p>A sixth feature of Black Freedom Studies is <strong>strategic importance of women\\u2019s leadership and the organizing tradition<\\/strong>. And there is some phenomenal new work on that subject, including not only <em>Sisters in the Struggle<\\/em> but also <em>Want to Start A Revolution: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle?<\\/em><\\/p><p>A seventh aspect of Black Freedom Studies is <strong>rethinking Malcolm X<\\/strong>. Given the controversy and Pulitzer Prize for Manning Marable\\u2019s recent biography, there is no shortage of important discussion on this subject. Of course, Malcolm X is at the center of rethinking Black Power; so the conversations that fashion some basic intellectual consensus on that research agenda is essential. With the Malcolm X papers at hand, there is no place better suited for such conversations than the Schomburg.<\\/p><p>An eighth dimension is that of <strong>Black Internationalism<\\/strong> and no community is better positioned than Harlem to appreciate the fact that the local is also simultaneously international. Michael West edited <em>From Toussaint to Tupac: The Black International Since the Age of Revolution<\\/em>. Brent Hayes Edwards has made a major contribution in <em>The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism<\\/em>. And Tyler Stovall complements that conversation with <em>Paris Noir: African Americans in the City of Light<\\/em>.<\\/p><p>Finally, since this is the fortieth anniversary of the 1972 Gary Agenda, we might consider some public policy and self-governance conversations about <strong>the contours of the National Black Agenda<\\/strong> then and now, including the Harlem Agenda for 2012 and the future.<\\/p>\"}}','2014-09-04 18:53:19','2014-09-04 18:53:19','9c2de62d-463a-4c4f-868c-e3a442ac7abb'),(197,157,3,1,'en_us',5,'','{\"typeId\":\"3\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"Education for

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>One longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>Similarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>Thus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.<\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar. Our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies.<\\/p>\"}},\"197\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"How to apply\",\"sectionContent\":\"<ol>\\r\\n<li>Review Eligibility<\\/li><li>Fill out information form and submit a CV<\\/li><li>Application Statement: This workshop is for faculty actively doing work on Black Freedom Studies in the Jim Crow North.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>One longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>Similarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>Thus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field.

In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff.

At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and <em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 <em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures <em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was <em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In <em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tFor decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and \\r\\n\\t<em>numerous<\\/em> locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches. In fact, similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the South and North, the story is intertwined. For instance, the 1950s Montgomery Bus Boycott was preceded by the Harlem Bus Boycott of the 1940s. Angered by the bus boycott and Northern hypocrisy, the <em>Montgomery Advertiser<\\/em>, the main Montgomery newspaper, took to running articles during the boycott year on Northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to Montgomery. Rosa Parks herself was forced to leave Montgomery and moved to Detroit&mdash;\\u201cthe promised land that wasn\\u2019t\\u201d as she termed it&mdash;where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city. Yet, in the old master narrative, that half of her life was historically invisible.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tOne longstanding key issue is school segregation. In fact, segregated education has longer roots in the Jim Crow North, where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the Civil War. From New York and Canterbury to Boston and New Canaan, New Hampshire, blacks and whites were schooled separately, and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence. Between Independence Day and Labor Day in 1835, white mobs in New Canaan attacked the interracial Noyes Academy, bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp. Similarly, white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack Prudence Crandall\\u2019s interracial girls-academy in Canterbury, Connecticut; and the Quaker Prudence Crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating Black girls. In Boston, parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts, starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 \\r\\n\\t<em>Plessy<\\/em> v. <em>Ferguson<\\/em> Supreme Court decision to the 1955 <em>Brown<\\/em> <em>v.<\\/em> <em>Board<\\/em> of Education II Supreme Court decision and into the 1970s Boston Busing Crisis.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tSimilarly, in the Jim Crow West, Donna Murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for African Americans migrants and the massive development of the California juvenile detention system. In other words, the children of Black migrants, particularly the boys, were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system, which Murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow West. Was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis, juvenile detention systems, and rising Black Power movements in the Jim Crow North and the Jim Crow Midwest? Such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in Black Freedom Studies as scholars look at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago with new eyes.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThus, the research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures \\r\\n\\t<em>beyond the South<\\/em>&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tIf the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty was \\r\\n\\t<em>not <\\/em>the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War, including works such as Ira Katznelson\\u2018s <em>When Affirmative Action Was White<\\/em> and Mary Poole\\u2018s <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security,<\\/em> as well as Thomas Sugrue\\u2018s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis<\\/em> and <em>Sweet Land of Liberty<\\/em>. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tAbove all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. In \\r\\n\\t<em>The Business of Black Power<\\/em>, Laura Hill and Julia Rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in Newark, New Jersey; unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and Black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math. Moreover, scholars found the same pattern of history from Las Vegas to Baltimore. In <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought their Own War on Poverty<\\/em>, Annelise Orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in Las Vegas; and in <em>The Politics of Public Housing: Black Women\\u2019s Struggles Against Urban Inequality,<\\/em>Rhonda Williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in Baltimore shaped by tenant organizations. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tWe will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. Most projects on the Black freedom struggle require resources from the Schomburg\\u2019s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in New York City.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThe project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

Yet, until recently, these campaigns have not received the historical attention they have deserved. Poor people&mdash;and poor Black mothers in particular&mdash;reshaped notions of rights, dignity, and citizenship in struggles across the country. They redefined militancy and self-determination, insisting that public assistance and economic access were a key to a free Black people. These grassroots struggles led President Lyndon Johnson\'s to declare a federal commitment to a War on Poverty. While that war was under-resourced and dwarfed by the War in Vietnam, people across the country fought to make programs responsive to the needs and perspectives of the poor as well as the privileged. Join us for a timely discussion as four scholars discuss how grassroots campaigns for welfare rights and economic justice, sought to make the federal government accountable to poor people and the successes and limitations of the War on Poverty programs that were created.\\\"&nbsp;<\\/p><p>-- Jeanne Theoharis<\\/p>\",\"19\":\"\",\"24\":\"\",\"14\":[\"90\",\"94\",\"92\"],\"17\":[\"206\"]}}','2014-10-16 20:42:41','2014-10-16 20:42:41','91e3be92-0654-4273-b4fa-2fcab4e6fae6'),(258,207,5,1,'en_us',1,'','{\"typeId\":\"8\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"The Blues People 50 Years Later\",\"slug\":\"the-blues-people-50-years-later\",\"postDate\":1413492249,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"2\":\"\",\"5\":{\"date\":\"10\\/3\\/2013\"},\"3\":\"\",\"15\":\"<iframe src=\\\"\\/\\/player.vimeo.com\\/video\\/107619665?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\"}}','2014-10-16 20:44:09','2014-10-16 20:44:09','67965e65-5fce-4a81-a9ed-4f63eb454796'),(259,86,3,1,'en_us',5,'','{\"typeId\":\"3\",\"authorId\":\"1\",\"title\":\"The Blues People 50 Years Later\",\"slug\":\"the-blues-people\",\"postDate\":1408998060,\"expiryDate\":null,\"enabled\":1,\"fields\":{\"13\":[\"83\",\"84\",\"85\"],\"5\":{\"date\":\"10\\/3\\/2013\"},\"18\":\"<p>Inspired by Amiri Baraka\\u2019s Blues People: Negro Music in White America (1963), a generation of scholars in the field of Jazz and Blues music history and criticism was born, creating a legitimate space in the academy for the serious study of African American music.

the past decade, a burgeoning scholarship on freedom movements outside of the South has reframed our understandings of the Black Freedom Struggle in the United States.  It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand.   This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; returns the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.  Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.   This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \\u201cRethinking Black Freedom Studies in the Jim Crow North\\u201d will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching\\/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship.  We welcome scholars across the disciplines of history, political science, music, theater and the arts, urban studies, literature, women\\u2019s studies, and Black studies and a multiplicity of viewpoints and approaches.    Graduate students, lecturers, tenure track and tenured faculty are all encouraged to apply.  The seminar will be run by Komozi Woodard (Sarah Lawrence College) and Jeanne Theoharis (Brooklyn College of CUNY) and held from June 16-25, 2015 at Sarah Lawrence College and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Sixteen participants will be chosen and participants are required to every day of the seminar.  Everyone in the seminar will workshop a project, whether a draft article, chapter or syllabus.  Applications will be due on March 2, 2015\"}},\"199\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Description\",\"sectionContent\":\"<center>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/\\\"><img src=\\\"\\/assets\\/images\\/graphics\\/neh_logo_horizontal_rgb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"neh_logo_horizontal_rgb.jpg#asset:196\\\"><\\/a><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>An NEH Summer Seminar for College and University Teachers<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>June 15&nbsp;-&nbsp;June 26, 2015 (2 weeks)&nbsp;<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Deadline: March 2, 2015<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bronxville, NY<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<em>Updates on application process coming soon<\\/em><\\/p><\\/center>\\r\\n<p>For decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the Civil Rights struggle in the Jim Crow South, neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the Black Freedom struggle from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West. This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand.   This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; returns the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.  Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \\u201cRethinking Black Freedom Studies in the Jim Crow North\\u201d will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching\\/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States.

Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it.

Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. <\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Disclaimer<\\/strong>: <em>Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in&nbsp;<\\/em><em>this program do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program of study\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. <\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field.

The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; returns the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. <\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; returns the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.  Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.<\\/p><p>This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \\u201cRethinking Black Freedom Studies in the Jim Crow North\\u201d will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching\\/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship. We welcome scholars across the disciplines of history, political science, music, theater and the arts, urban studies, literature, women\\u2019s studies, and Black studies and a multiplicity of viewpoints and approaches.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. <\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field. Furthermore, we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>The seminar will uphold the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/grants\\/principles-civility\\\">principles of civility<\\/a> outlined by the NEH.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Disclaimer<\\/strong>: <em>Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in&nbsp;<\\/em><em>this program do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program of study\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. Consequently, scholars have discovered that the Black Revolt in the Jim Crow North challenged American Apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice.<\\/p><p>If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks. Certain days, we will meet at the Schomburg Center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with Schomburg staff. <\\/p><p>The project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants. At the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors, teachers, and students can draw from it. The website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of Conversations on Black Freedom Studies and the International Symposium on Black Power Studies. Such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field.

Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty. If cultural poverty wasnot the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs routinely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where important ideas and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the North and South.<\\/p><p>We will ask each participant to bring an article-length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks.

This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions. Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.<\\/p><p>This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \\u201cRethinking Black Freedom Studies from the Jim Crow North to the  Jim Crow West\\u201d will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching\\/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity.Many faculty working in this area, particularly younger scholars, would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject. Thus, the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern history and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the Civil Rights &amp; Black Power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the United States. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography, chronology, economy and policy, as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches.  <\\/p><p>The research agenda for Black Freedom Studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of Jim Crow America. The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South, not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions. Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.<\\/p><p>This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \\u201cRethinking Black Freedom Studies from the Jim Crow North to the  Jim Crow West\\u201d will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching\\/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship. We welcome scholars across the disciplines of history, political science, music, theater and the arts, urban studies, literature, women\\u2019s studies, and Black studies and a multiplicity of viewpoints and approaches. Graduate students, lecturers, tenure track and tenured faculty are all encouraged to apply.<\\/p><p>The seminar will be run by Komozi Woodard (Sarah Lawrence College) and Jeanne Theoharis (Brooklyn College of CUNY) and held from June 16-25, 2015 at Sarah Lawrence College and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies.

If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life.

The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War.

By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty.

The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies.

The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge it on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\\u2019s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area. <\\/p><p>The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South&mdash;but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.<\\/p><p>If a \\u2018culture of poverty\\u2019 was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.<\\/p><p>The new scholarship&mdash;which we will survey in this two-week seminar&mdash; paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles&mdash;not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North<\\/em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.<\\/p><p>The academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies&nbsp;series at the Schomburg&nbsp;because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.   It is that community of insight, feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this NEH summer seminar. &nbsp;<\\/p>\"}},\"233\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Eligibility\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>Review the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/files\\/divisions\\/education\\/eligibility\\/college_university_eligibility_criteria.pdf\\\">Eligibility Criteria<\\/a> for NEH Summer Seminars for College and University Teachers.<\\/p>\"}},\"198\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Apply\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>Complete the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/securegrants.neh.gov\\/education\\/participants\\/\\\">NEH application cover sheet<\\/a>.<\\/p><p>We will be posting the online application in the near future.<\\/p><p>Applicants will be required to submit a C.V.; a 1000 word&nbsp;statement of their project which must be related to Black Freedom Studies from the Jim Crow North to the Jim Crow West&nbsp;and how their work will benefit from being in the seminar; and a draft chapter (that they will be the basis of the chapter they will workshop during the seminar.<\\/p>\"}},\"236\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Housing\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>Sarah Lawrence College is located on 44 wooded acres in Yonkers, New York, so near the village of Bronxville that most people think it is located in Bronxville.

This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\'s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South\\u2014but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf a \'culture of poverty\' was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship\\u2014which we will survey in this two-week seminar\\u2014 paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles\\u2014not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will incorporate at least five components:\\r\\n<\\/p><ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>readings in this field<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>participant writing workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>research sessions<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>informational workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>discussions of the writing process from research to publication. <\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><p>\\r\\n\\tEach participant will bring a project to be workshopped\\u2014whether a draft article or curriculum document.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or curricular approach that s\\/he is working towards that may be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field, work-shopping, and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIn turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\'s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development.  They will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research.  Effectively, then, the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other\'s projects, who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed. The classes will be divided between surveying the historiography, writing history and curriculum, workshopping those projects, and independent archival research..\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts. We will read chapters from a variety of the most current research in the field.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North<\\/em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies series at the Schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.   It is that community of insight, feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this NEH summer seminar.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"233\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Eligibility\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tReview the \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/files\\/divisions\\/education\\/eligibility\\/college_university_eligibility_criteria.pdf\\\">Eligibility Criteria<\\/a> for NEH Summer Seminars for College and University Teachers.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"198\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Apply\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe application requires the following:\\r\\n\\t<br>\\r\\n<\\/p><ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Complete the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/securegrants.neh.gov\\/education\\/participants\\/\\\">NEH application cover sheet<\\/a> and attach a copy<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Attach a C.V.<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A 1000-word essay outlining why you want to take part in the seminar, what you bring to the seminar, and what project you will be working on during the seminar (book chapter; article-in-progress; syllabus; other pedagogical project).

This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\'s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South\\u2014but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf a \'culture of poverty\' was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship\\u2014which we will survey in this two-week seminar\\u2014 paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles\\u2014not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will incorporate at least five components:\\r\\n<\\/p><ol><li>readings in this field<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>participant writing workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>research sessions<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>informational workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>discussions of the writing process from research to publication. <\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><p>\\r\\n\\tEach participant will bring a project to be workshopped\\u2014whether a draft article or curriculum document.

Each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field, work-shopping, and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIn turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\'s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development.  They will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research.  Effectively, then, the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other\'s projects, who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed. The classes will be divided between surveying the historiography, writing history and curriculum, workshopping those projects, and independent archival research..\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North<\\/em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies series at the Schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.   It is that community of insight, feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this NEH summer seminar.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"233\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Eligibility\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tReview the \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/files\\/divisions\\/education\\/eligibility\\/college_university_eligibility_criteria.pdf\\\">Eligibility Criteria<\\/a> for NEH Summer Seminars for College and University Teachers.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"198\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Apply\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe application requires the following:\\r\\n\\t<br><\\/p><ul><li>Complete the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/securegrants.neh.gov\\/education\\/participants\\/\\\">NEH application cover sheet<\\/a> and attach a copy<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Attach a C.V.<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A 1000-word essay outlining why you want to take part in the seminar, what you bring to the seminar, and what project you will be working on during the seminar (book chapter; article-in-progress; syllabus; other pedagogical project).

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South\\u2014but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf a \'culture of poverty\' was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship.

The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will incorporate at least five components:\\r\\n<\\/p><ol><li>readings in this field<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>participant writing workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>research sessions<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>informational workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>discussions of the writing process from research to publication. <\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><p>\\r\\n\\tEach participant will bring a project to be workshopped\\u2014whether a draft article or curriculum document.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or curricular approach that s\\/he is working towards that may be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field, work-shopping, and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIn turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\'s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development.  They will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research.  Effectively, then, the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other\'s projects, who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed. The classes will be divided between surveying the historiography, writing history and curriculum, workshopping those projects, and independent archival research..\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts. We will read chapters from a variety of the most current research in the field.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North<\\/em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies series at the Schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.   It is that community of insight, feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this NEH summer seminar.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"233\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Eligibility\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tReview the \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.neh.gov\\/files\\/divisions\\/education\\/eligibility\\/college_university_eligibility_criteria.pdf\\\">Eligibility Criteria<\\/a> for NEH Summer Seminars for College and University Teachers.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"198\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Apply\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe application requires the following:\\r\\n\\t<br><\\/p><ul><li>Complete the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/securegrants.neh.gov\\/education\\/participants\\/\\\">NEH application cover sheet<\\/a> and attach a copy<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Attach a C.V.<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A 1000-word essay outlining why you want to take part in the seminar, what you bring to the seminar, and what project you will be working on during the seminar (book chapter; article-in-progress; syllabus; other pedagogical project).

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge those roots on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\'s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South\\u2014but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIf a \'culture of poverty\' was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe new scholarship\\u2014which we will survey in this two-week seminar\\u2014 paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles\\u2014not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\\r\\n<\\/p>\"}},\"200\":{\"type\":\"textSection\",\"enabled\":\"1\",\"fields\":{\"sectionHeading\":\"Program\",\"sectionContent\":\"<p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe seminar will incorporate at least five components:\\r\\n<\\/p><ol><li>readings in this field<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>participant writing workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>research sessions<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>informational workshops<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>discussions of the writing process from research to publication. <\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><p>\\r\\n\\tEach participant will bring a project to be workshopped\\u2014whether a draft article or curriculum document.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or curricular approach that s\\/he is working towards that may be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field, work-shopping, and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tIn turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\'s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development.  They will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research.  Effectively, then, the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other\'s projects, who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed. The classes will be divided between surveying the historiography, writing history and curriculum, workshopping those projects, and independent archival research..\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts. We will read chapters from a variety of the most current research in the field.

Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North<\\/em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies series at the Schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.

This seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in Black Freedom Studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership, geography, chronology, economy, and polity. The time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the Black Freedom Struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area.\n</p><p>\n	The old paradigm of Civil Rights as an exclusively Southern story and Black Power as a predominantly Northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship. The old North-South and Civil Rights-Black Power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period.The racism found in the North was presumed to be a weak transplant from the South—but as scholars have amply shown, that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of Northern municipal governance, schooling, housing policy, and policing. If the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the Jim Crow North, then the new scholarship tracing Northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to Black ghetto life. Meanwhile, the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance, and the Black Arts Renaissance; and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty.\n</p><p>\n	If a \'culture of poverty\' was not the problem of the Jim Crow North, then what was the problem? The new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the New Deal to the Cold War. The New Deal transformed Social Citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership, providing GI Bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians. By contrast, those same programs largely excluded Black America from the bounty of New Deal Citizenship. Above all, the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own War on Poverty. This inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of Civil Rights and Black Power, making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible.\n</p><p>\n	The new scholarship—which we will survey in this two-week seminar— paints an epic portrait of the Black Freedom Movement, where ideas, organizing initiatives, and impressive programs of self-emancipation and self-respect circulated in the Jim Crow North between Philadelphia and Boston, in the Jim Crow Midwest between Detroit and Milwaukee, and in the Jim Crow West between Oakland and Los Angeles—not to mention, the cross-fertilization of ideas between the North and the South, including the 1941 Harlem Bus Boycott and the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-10-09 14:24:41','2015-01-20 17:03:01','27f2e714-4800-4879-9eb4-6f72f194e6b1'),(4,200,'en_us','Program','<p>\n	The seminar will be held the last two weeks of June.  The heart of this two-week seminar is to advance the historiography, scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in Black Freedom Studies. The seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field; thus, the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing. The participating scholars will examine the seminar readings, unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative, plot and character development.  At another level, discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted.\n</p><p>\n	The seminar will incorporate at least five components:\n</p><ol><li>readings in this field</li>\n	<li>participant writing workshops</li>\n	<li>research sessions</li>\n	<li>informational workshops</li>\n	<li>discussions of the writing process from research to publication. </li>\n</ol><p>\n	Each participant will bring a project to be workshopped—whether a draft article or curriculum document.  Once selected and before the seminar begins, each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research, analysis, or curricular approach that s/he is working towards that may be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar.  Each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field, work-shopping, and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors.\n</p><p>\n	In turn, seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person\'s writing in terms of argument, propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development.  They will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research.  Effectively, then, the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other\'s projects, who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed. The classes will be divided between surveying the historiography, writing history and curriculum, workshopping those projects, and independent archival research..\n</p><p>\n	The first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts. We will read chapters from a variety of the most current research in the field. The second week will be focus on the writing process, with workshopping; research sessions at the Schomburg, and presentations by publishers and newly-published scholars.\n</p><p>\n	The following is a tentative schedule for the two weeks.\n</p><p>\n	First week:\n</p><ul><li>Monday June 15 Morning: Introduction to the Historiography of Black Freedom in the Jim Crow North including portions of the following: Jeanne Theoharis and Komozi Woodard, <em>Freedom North</em> and <em>Groundwork</em>; Carl Nightingale, <em>Segregation: A Global History of Divided Cities</em>; Matthew Lassiter and Joe Crespino, <em>The Myth of Southern Exceptionalism</em>; Thomas Sugrue, <em>Sweet Land of Liberty,</em> and Mary Poole, <em>The Segregated Origins of Social Security</em>.</li>\n	<li>Monday June 15 Afternoon: Scholarship, Thinking, and Writing.

She and Komozi Woodard have edited three collections of new scholarship on the Black Freedom Struggle: <em>Freedom North: Black Freedom Struggles Outside of the South, 1940-1980</em>; <em>Groundwork: Local Black Freedom Movements in America</em> and <em>Want to Start A Revolution?: Radical Women in the Black Freedom Struggle</em> with Dayo Gore.\n</p><p>\n	<img src=\"{asset:178:thumbcc}\" alt=\"\" style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:14px;float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px;\" /></p><p>\n	<strong>14 Years of Collaboration</strong>\n</p><p>\n	Part of the concept of our first anthology \n	<em>Freedom North</em> was that our research and insights were stronger together; that key to overturning the Southern focus of civil rights history was to show how deep and state-sanctioned segregation and racial inequality was across the Northeast, Midwest and West and demonstrate how many Northern cities had robust movements (Newark, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Oakland).  Getting work published on the North had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point.  It had taken years for me to get a single article published on Boston\'s educational movement.   So the idea behind <em>Freedom North</em> was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves.\n</p><p>\n	The academy, like other parts of American society, often values individualism and, as such, the individual monograph.  But part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together.   We have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the Conversations in Black Freedom Studies series at the Schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past. For more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance.   It is that community of insight, feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this NEH summer seminar.\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-10-09 21:27:02','2015-01-20 17:03:01','b43355a0-3629-4264-8976-7625c9c1d4b7'),(6,202,'en_us','Stipend','<p>\n	Individuals selected to participate will receive $2,100.

It shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the United States on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the Northeast, Midwest, and West that flowered alongside those in the South to challenge those roots on the other hand. This new framework broadens the timeline, expands our understandings of the Civil Rights movement, labor, and women\'s liberation movements; foregrounds the central role of youth; and shows that women were pivotal in leadership, strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions. Moreover, this scholarship shows the importance of a number of Black alliances and coalitions with Latino, Asian American and Native American movements.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	This two-week NEH summer faculty seminar entitled \r\n	<strong>“Rethinking Black Freedom Studies from the Jim Crow North to the  Jim Crow West\"</strong> will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching/curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship. We welcome scholars across the disciplines of history, political science, music, theater and the arts, urban studies, literature, women\'s studies, and Black studies and a multiplicity of viewpoints and approaches. Graduate students, lecturers, tenure track and tenured faculty are all encouraged to apply.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	The seminar will be run by \r\n	<strong>Komozi Woodard</strong> (Sarah Lawrence College) and <strong>Jeanne Theoharis</strong> (Brooklyn College of CUNY) and held from June 16-25, 2015 at <strong>Sarah Lawrence College</strong> and the <strong>Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</strong>. Sixteen participants will be chosen and participants are required to attend every day of the seminar. Everyone in the seminar will workshop a project, whether a draft article, chapter or syllabus.

It is also just north of Harlem: a 15 minute drive up the Henry Hudson Parkway or a 20 minute ride on the Metro-North from the Harlem Station-- and a 30 minute train ride from Grand Central Station in Midtown Manhattan. The Bronxville train station is within walking distance from the campus; and public bus service runs on Kimball Avenue that divides the campus in half.\n</p><p>\n	Campus housing at Sarah Lawrence College will be available for summer scholars; and information about the off-campus options is forthcoming. With the aim of creating a scholarly community, it would be ideal with summer scholars lived in close proximity so that group discussions can take place spontaneously after the seminars and on the weekend.\n</p><p>\n	There are three Sarah Lawrence College libraries. The main one, the Esther Raushenbush Library, holds more than 300,000 books, government documents, microfilms, audiocassettes, DVDs, and subscribes to more than 700 journals and newspapers. Moreover, the library offers access to more than 80 online full-text and citation databases, thus providing access to at least 37,000 journals. The second library is the music library located in the William Schumann Field Music Building, with listening facilities and book collections on music, musicians as well as periodicals, scores, and sound recordings. The third library is the Sarah Lawrence College Visual Resources image collection located in the Heimbold Visual Arts Center, including more than 20,000 digital images. The computer Center is located in the Main Library. Also, the Campus is wired for WiFi. The Heimbold Visual Arts Center is 60,000 square feet dedicated to digital imagery, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture and visual fundamentals.

The college is located in East Yonkers, a few blocks from the Cross County Shopping Mall. And the campus is located between at least three supermarkets, including one at the Cross County Shopping Mall; one in downtown Bronxville; and one in the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon. By design, Westchester County replaced major “downtown\" shopping with a shopping area on Central Park Avenue that reaches several miles north from Yonkers to White Plains. Moreover, the Ridge Hill Mall is nearby in Yonkers right off Tuckahoe Road and near that city\'s hotel district.\n</p><p>\n	Computer supplies, office supplies and Apple stores are in several locations nearby, including the Apple store in the Ridge Hill Mall and the others in numerous malls on Central Park Avenue.\n</p><p>\n	Drug stores are located in downtown Bronxville in addition to numerous places nearby.\n</p><p>\n	The nearest hospital is the Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville and there is are a number of doctor\'s offices in Bronxville, Eastchester and the nearby Ridge Hill Mall includes the WestMed medical center.Lodging and travel information will be added in the near future.\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-11-14 18:46:49','2015-01-20 17:03:01','46aedd5a-d67f-4b16-a92f-55e5a0325766');

more information kwoodard sarahlawrence edu 914 395 2427 supported by a grant from the national endowment of the humanities many faculty working in this area particularly younger scholars would like to deepen their knowledge of this burgeoning field of study as well as work on their own scholarship in the company of others versed in the subject thus the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the black freedom struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area for decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the civil rights struggle in the jim crow south neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the black freedom struggle from the jim crow north to the jim crow west this seminar would introduce the emerging paradigm in black freedom studies that is replacing the old master narrative in terms of leadership geography chronology economy and polity the old paradigm of civil rights as an exclusively southern history and black power as a predominantly northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship that analyzes the civil rights black power movements in several regions and numerous locations in the united states the old north south and civil rights black power dichotomies blinded scholars to serious problems in the logic of geography chronology economy and policy as well as stories of leadership and culture that blended approaches in fact similar to the lives of many of the activists who worked in both the south and north the story is intertwined for instance the 1950s montgomery bus boycott was preceded by the harlem bus boycott of the 1940s angered by the bus boycott and northern hypocrisy the montgomery advertiser the main montgomery newspaper took to running articles during the boycott year on northern towns with attitudes and practices similar to montgomery rosa parks herself was forced to leave montgomery and moved to detroit the promised land that wasn t as she termed it where she would spend the second half of her life challenging racial inequality in the city yet in the old master narrative that half of her life was historically invisible one longstanding key issue is school segregation in fact segregated education has longer roots in the jim crow north where civil rights activists and abolitionists fought the exclusion and segregation of black students beginning decades before the civil war from new york and canterbury to boston and new canaan new hampshire blacks and whites were schooled separately and those who dared to create interracial spaces were often met with violence between independence day and labor day in 1835 white mobs in new canaan attacked the interracial noyes academy bringing a number of oxen in order to pull the school off its foundation and dump it into a swamp similarly white mobs stormed out of church in order to attack prudence crandall s interracial girls academy in canterbury connecticut and the quaker prudence crandall was imprisoned and exiled for the crime of educating black girls in boston parents and abolitionists attacked educational segregation in the courts starting a legal history that runs through the 1896 plessy v ferguson supreme court decision to the 1955 brown v board of education ii supreme court decision and into the 1970s boston busing crisis similarly in the jim crow west donna murch discovered a decisive linkage between the public education for african americans migrants and the massive development of the california juvenile detention system in other words the children of black migrants particularly the boys were socialized in a new juvenile version of the penal system which murch suggests is part of the hidden transcript of the black revolt in the jim crow west was there a similar linkage between the public school crisis juvenile detention systems and rising black power movements in the jim crow north and the jim crow midwest such issues are part of the new research agenda developing in black freedom studies as scholars look at philadelphia new york boston detroit and chicago with new eyes thus the research agenda for black freedom studies has changed dramatically not only in terms of public policy issues but also geography and chronology in order to understand the roots and branches of jim crow america the racism found in the north was presumed to be a weak transplant from the south not rooted in the systems and power structures beyond the south but as scholars have amply shown that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of northern municipal governance schooling housing policy and policing consequently scholars have discovered that the black revolt in the jim crow north challenged american apartheid not only in education and real estate but also in governance and the administration of justice if the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the jim crow north then the new scholarship tracing northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to black ghetto life meanwhile the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the new negro movement the harlem renaissance the chicago black renaissance and the black arts renaissance and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty if cultural poverty was not the problem of the jim crow north then what was the problem the new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the new deal to the cold war including works such as ira katznelson s when affirmative action was white and mary poole s the segregated origins of social security as well as thomas sugrue s the origins of the urban crisis and sweet land of liberty the new deal transformed social citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership providing gi bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians by contrast those same programs routinely excluded black america from the bounty of new deal citizenship above all the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own war on poverty in the business of black power laura hill and julia rabig have gathered stories of tenant leaders and welfare activists who developed a remarkable number of affordable housing units in newark new jersey unemployed workers who fought for construction jobs in chicago philadelphia and pittsburgh and black youth organizations that opened their own independent schools with new curricula emphasizing science and math moreover scholars found the same pattern of history from las vegas to baltimore in storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty annelise orleck tells the stories of the remarkable grassroots leaders that transformed communities in las vegas and in the politics of public housing black women s struggles against urban inequality rhonda williams reveals the impressive accounts of the grassroots housing reforms in baltimore shaped by tenant organizations this inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of civil rights and black power making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible the new scholarship which we will survey in this two week seminar paints an epic portrait of the black freedom movement where important ideas and impressive programs of self emancipation and self respect circulated in the jim crow north between philadelphia and boston in the jim crow midwest between detroit and milwaukee and in the jim crow west between oakland and los angeles not to mention the cross fertilization of ideas like the bus boycotts that occurred between the north and south we will ask each participant to bring an article length portion of their project to work on and workshop over the two weeks certain days we will meet at the schomburg center so that part of the seminar will include time for researching in those collections and meeting with schomburg staff most projects on the black freedom struggle require resources from the schomburg s vast archival collections so this will be an added benefit of locating the seminar in new york city the project website will house not only syllabi but also lesson plans and the visual library outlined above and other books and articles suggested by the participants at the end of the seminar we will have a rich bibliography online so that other professors teachers and students can draw from it the website will be designed so that teachers and professor may also stream videos of conversations on black freedom studies and the international symposium on black power studies such scholarly conversations should be helpful to teachers and professors who are developing curriculum and lessons in this field furthermore we hope to pull together an anthology out of the work produced in the seminar our editor is eager for more work in the field and we have worked with her on our previous three anthologies program of study the seminar will be held the last two weeks of june many professors use june for their own research and july august for family vacations which is why we want to schedule it in june also the sarah lawrence college facilities are available during that period the heart of this two week seminar is to advance the historiography and scholarship of the participants who are writing and teaching in black freedom studies and the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field thus the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing the participating scholars will examine the seminar readings at one level unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument propositions and organizational design as well as narrative plot and character development at another level discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted the seminar will incorporate readings in the field and participant writing workshops research and informational sessions as well as discussion of processes from research to publication once selected and before the seminar begins each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research analysis or approach that s he is working towards that will be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar each session will

freedom studies is a monthly roundtable discussion at the schomburg center with authors and experts in black history held on the first thursday of every month from 6 8 pm these conversations focus on a theme from the jim crow north to the black panther party from educational inequality to the black arts movement they are geared for new york city teachers parents students scholars activists and policy makers black freedom studies has introduced a new paradigm for research and scholarship on the long black revolt challenging older conceptions of geography leadership ideology culture and chronology to deepen popular understandings of the scope of the black freedom struggle with the closing of a number of black bookstores there are fewer spaces where a diversity of people can gather to hear and discuss new scholarship in african american history cbfs aims to begin to fill that need one dimension of the series is the significance of the intergenerational findings that have emerged in the research in other words the new paradigm suggests a dramatically different chronology in black freedom studies including at least two generations for instance amiri baraka s mentors included not only sterling brown and margaret walker from the popular front generation but also langston hughes from the harlem renaissance second another aspect of black freedom studies is the importance of the harlem grassroots intellectual tradition in other words for far too long we have neglected malcolm x as a working class intellectual alongside the fact that malcolm x was representative of a grassroots intellectual tradition that predated antonio gramsci the work on hubert harrison the socrates of the harlem renaissance and the use of the negro world as a vehicle for a mass self education movement provides another important window into that grand harlem tradition that tradition of mass self education was the groundwork for the each one teach one practices in the black arts renaissance and the black power movement with its countless liberation schools student study circles museum libraries and salons these discussions may be helpful to teachers parents and students facing the challenges of austerity policies a third dimension of black freedom studies is the promising emphasis on culture centering on the black arts renaissance ironically harlem has been grossly neglected in the new black arts movement scholarship and that neglect is distorting the contours of that research we should take advantage of the pioneers and veterans of the black arts renaissance in harlem that remain available for roundtable discussions if those conversations are recorded they might serve as primary sources for the scholarship to come sam anderson jitu weusi ted wilson amiri baraka sonia sanchez are close at hand and we should take the opportunity to consider the nuyorican arts renaissance that flowered at times alongside and at times within the bosom of the black arts movement felipe luciano can shed light on the working of the last poets from that vantage point and of course the rest of the remaining last poets should be at the center of such a roundtable furthermore askia toure is not far away and he was also a pioneer in the black arts movement alongside lou gossett and so forth harlem was the home of langston hughes who seems to have cultivated the groundwork for many features of the black arts renaissance including its international character and thus far we have neglected important figures like elombe brath who political and cultural work in black culture and consciousness began to flower in the 1950s attracting many african liberation leaders to the bosom of harlem in fact next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of blues people and when i organized the 40th anniversary symposium at sarah lawrence college the response was overwhelming a fourth aspect of black freedom studies in the importance of political activism and public policy alternatives in the black revolt in the jim crow north johanna fernandez has highlighted the way that the young lords used mass media to dramatize long dormant public policy problems like lead paint to make crucial changes of course the young lords were in the tradition of sncc and the civil rights revolution and we could not miss an opportunity to talk about brooklyn and the bronx core and so forth from the citizenship schools to the liberation schools black power aimed to train generations in not only self worth but also self governance a fifth characteristic of black freedom studies its attention to economic struggles captured in several anthologies such as the business of black power and black power at work in many ways this is the case of the genius of black labor that remains untold furthermore we might also consider the rekindled debates about the nature of internal colonialism in that venue a sixth feature of black freedom studies is strategic importance of women s leadership and the organizing tradition and there is some phenomenal new work on that subject including not only sisters in the struggle but also want to start a revolution radical women in the black freedom struggle a seventh aspect of black freedom studies is rethinking malcolm x given the controversy and pulitzer prize for manning marable s recent biography there is no shortage of important discussion on this subject of course malcolm x is at the center of rethinking black power so the conversations that fashion some basic intellectual consensus on that research agenda is essential with the malcolm x papers at hand there is no place better suited for such conversations than the schomburg an eighth dimension is that of black internationalism and no community is better positioned than harlem to appreciate the fact that the local is also simultaneously international michael west edited from toussaint to tupac the black international since the age of revolution brent hayes edwards has made a major contribution in the practice of diaspora literature translation and the rise of black internationalism and tyler stovall complements that conversation with paris noir african americans in the city of light finally since this is the fortieth anniversary of the 1972 gary agenda we might consider some public policy and self governance conversations about the contours of the national black agenda then and now including the harlem agenda for 2012 and the future '),(176,'filename',0,'en_us',' imgl7472 jpg '),(176,'extension',0,'en_us',' jpg '),(176,'kind',0,'en_us',' image

burgeoning scholarship on freedom movements outside of the south has reframed our understandings of the black freedom struggle in the united states it shows and documents the deep and wide roots of racial inequality and segregation across the united states on the one hand and the vast array of movements in the northeast midwest and west that flowered alongside those in the south to challenge those roots on the other hand this new framework broadens the timeline expands our understandings of the civil rights movement labor and women s liberation movements foregrounds the central role of youth and shows that women were pivotal in leadership strategy and organizing with international visions and grassroots dimensions moreover this scholarship shows the importance of a number of black alliances and coalitions with latino asian american and native american movements this two week neh summer faculty seminar entitled rethinking black freedom studies from the jim crow north to the jim crow west will bring together scholars working in this field and those interested in expanding their own teaching curriculum by getting a deep introduction in this expanding scholarship we welcome scholars across the disciplines of history political science music theater and the arts urban studies literature women s studies and black studies and a multiplicity of viewpoints and approaches

seminar for college and university teachers june 15 june 26 2015 2 weeks deadline march 2 2015 bronxville ny updates on application process coming soon for decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the civil rights struggle in the jim crow south neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the black freedom struggle from the jim crow north to the jim crow west this seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in black freedom studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership geography chronology economy and polity the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the black freedom struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area the old paradigm of civil rights as an exclusively southern story and black power as a predominantly northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship the old north south and civil rights black power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period the racism found in the north was presumed to be a weak transplant from the south but as scholars have amply shown that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of northern municipal governance schooling housing policy and policing if the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the jim crow north then the new scholarship tracing northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to black ghetto life meanwhile the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the new negro movement the harlem renaissance the chicago black renaissance and the black arts renaissance and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty if a culture of poverty was not the problem of the jim crow north then what was the problem the new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the new deal to the cold war the new deal transformed social citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership providing gi bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians by contrast those same programs largely excluded black america from the bounty of new deal citizenship above all the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own war on poverty this inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of civil rights and black power making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible the new scholarship which we will survey in this two week seminar paints an epic portrait of the black freedom movement where ideas organizing initiatives and impressive programs of self emancipation and self respect circulated in the jim crow north between philadelphia and boston in the jim crow midwest between detroit and milwaukee and in the jim crow west between oakland and los angeles not to mention the cross fertilization of ideas between the north and the south including the 1941 harlem bus boycott and the 1955 montgomery bus boycott description the seminar will be held the last two weeks of june the heart of this two week seminar is to advance the historiography scholarship and curriculum of the participants who are writing and teaching in black freedom studies the seminar aims to strengthen the teachable texts in the field thus the workshop method that we will employ emphasizes the linkage between teaching and writing the participating scholars will examine the seminar readings unpacking the contributions of the writing in terms of argument propositions and organizational design as well as narrative plot and character development at another level discussion will also focus on analyzing gaps or flaws in the research or analysis or places where further research or analysis might be warranted the seminar will incorporate at least five components readings in this field participant writing workshops research sessions informational workshops discussions of the writing process from research to publication each participant will bring a project to be workshopped whether a draft article or curriculum document once selected and before the seminar begins each participant will also suggest one article or chapter that is a model for the kind of research analysis or curricular approach that s he is working towards that may be incorporated into the recommended readings for the seminar each session will encompass the discussion of readings in this field work shopping and various guest lecturers from scholars in the field and editors in turn seminar participants will exchange drafts and in a collegial manner present evaluations of the effectiveness of each person s writing in terms of argument propositions and organizational design as well as narrative development they will suggest improvements with editorial recommendations and suggestions for further research effectively then the seminar will create a community of scholars invested in each other s projects who will constitute an ongoing resource to draw upon even after the seminar is completed the classes will be divided between surveying the historiography writing history and curriculum workshopping those projects and independent archival research the first week emphasizes the emerging research agenda and conceptualization in several key texts we will read chapters from a variety of the most current research in the field the second week will be focus on the writing process with workshopping research sessions at the schomburg and presentations by publishers and newly published scholars the

the concept of our first anthology freedom north was that our research and insights were stronger together that key to overturning the southern focus of civil rights history was to show how deep and state sanctioned segregation and racial inequality was across the northeast midwest and west and demonstrate how many northern cities had robust movements newark boston detroit new york chicago oakland getting work published on the north had been an exceedingly uphill battle up to that point it had taken years for me to get a single article published on boston s educational movement so the idea behind freedom north was that this collection would make a more powerful intervention than any of us could by ourselves the academy like other parts of american society often values individualism and as such the individual monograph but part of what we have learned over the past fourteen years is that our insights are clearer when discussed together and our perspectives are more powerful when we pursue different strands together we have chosen to do three anthologies of new research and create the conversations in black freedom studies series at the schomburg because through these collective endeavors comes a more complex and textured vision of the past for more than a decade we have endeavored to build a community of intellectual collaboration and sustenance it is that community of insight feedback and support that we are hoping to strengthen and expand through this neh summer seminar directors review the eligibility criteria for neh summer seminars for college and

seminar for college and university teachers june 15 june 26 2015 2 weeks deadline march 2 2015 bronxville ny updates on application process coming soon for decades the academic disciplines focused exclusively on the history of the civil rights struggle in the jim crow south neglecting the rich and critical legacy of the black freedom struggle from the jim crow north to the jim crow west this seminar will introduce the emerging paradigm in black freedom studies that is replacing the old narrative of the civil rights movement in terms of leadership geography chronology economy and polity the time is ripe to reform the college curriculum on the black freedom struggle and to convene a summer workshop specifically devoted to producing scholarship in this area the old paradigm of civil rights as an exclusively southern story and black power as a predominantly northern phenomenon has been powerfully challenged by a new generation of scholarship the old north south and civil rights black power dichotomies are insufficient in capturing the diversities of movements that took place across the country in the postwar period the racism found in the north was presumed to be a weak transplant from the south but as scholars have amply shown that view was resoundingly mistaken and the problem was deeply entrenched in the structures and systems of northern municipal governance schooling housing policy and policing if the old paradigm emphasized cultural poverty in the jim crow north then the new scholarship tracing northern racial discrimination from colonial slavery to the 1960s foregrounds the real estate and banking industries as well as housing and job markets not behaviors and family structure as the key determinant to black ghetto life meanwhile the burgeoning research in cultural history has enriched our understanding of the new negro movement the harlem renaissance the chicago black renaissance and the black arts renaissance and that formidable cultural and social history supplants the threadbare theory of cultural poverty if a culture of poverty was not the problem of the jim crow north then what was the problem the new scholarship suggests the answers are located in public policy and political economy from the new deal to the cold war the new deal transformed social citizenship propelling many white working households from renting urban tenements to suburban homeownership providing gi bill scholarships to turn workers into professionals and technicians by contrast those same programs largely excluded black america from the bounty of new deal citizenship above all the new history informs us that countless grassroots leaders fought their own war on poverty this inspiring work has enriched and complicated the narrative of civil rights and black power making the cultural poverty narrative nearly implausible the new scholarship which we will survey in this two week seminar paints an epic portrait of the black freedom movement where ideas organizing initiatives and impressive programs of self emancipation and self respect circulated in the jim crow north between philadelphia and boston in the jim crow midwest between detroit and milwaukee and in the jim crow west between oakland and los angeles not to mention the cross fertilization of ideas between the north and the south including the 1941 harlem bus boycott and the 1955 montgomery bus boycott '),(199,'slug',0,'en_us',''),(207,'field',3,'en_us',''),(207,'slug',0,'en_us',' the blues people 50 years later '),(207,'title',0,'en_us',' the blues people 50 years
